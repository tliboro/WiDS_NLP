This method creates a modified version of a representation by moving its values away from where they are computed, so as to produce a better localization of the signal components. We first propose a new formulation of this method, followed by a thorough theoretical study of its characteristics. Its practical use for a large variety of known time-frequency and time-scale distributions is then addressed. Finally, some experimental results are reported to demonstrate the performance of this method. &gt;"",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Franois Auger"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Fran%C3%A7ois-Auger/100548599""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Patrick Flandrin"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Patrick-Flandrin/1721271""}],""publication"":""IEEE Trans.

The direct cross-correlation method is analyzed and compared to the average square difference function (ASDF) and the (addition only based) average magnitude difference function (AMDF) estimators, Their relative accuracy is theoretically evaluated, and previous empirical results are explained. It is shown that both the ASDF- and the AMDF-based estimators outperform the direct cross-correlation based estimator for medium-high signal-to-noise ratios.

We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume. We adopt a recent approach [14] for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure, and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection, and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment, and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, nonrigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action, and low-quality video."",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Lena Gorelick"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Lena-Gorelick/3089071""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Moshe Blank"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Moshe-Blank/50170517""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Eli Shechtman"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Eli-Shechtman/2177801""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Michal Irani"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Michal-Irani/144611617""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Ronen Basri"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Ronen-Basri/1760994""}],""publication"":""IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"",""isPartOf"":""IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"",""publisher"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""name"":""IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence""},""copyrightYear"":""2007"",""datePublished"":""2007"",""image"":[{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""caption"":""Fig. 1.

We develop a novel probabilistic methodology based upon transfer operators that automatically detect maximally coherent sets. The approach is very simple to implement, requiring only singular vector computations of a matrix of transitions induced by the dynamics. We illustrate our new methodology on an idealized stratospheric flow and in two and three-dimensional analyses of European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis data."",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Gary Froyland"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Gary-Froyland/2926894""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Naratip Santitissadeekorn"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Naratip-Santitissadeekorn/1887536""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Adam H.

The proposed consensus control strategy is implemented based on the state information of each agent's neighbors at some discrete times. The asynchrony means that each agent's update times, at which the agent adjusts its dynamics, are independent of others'. Furthermore, it is assumed that the communication topology among agents is time-dependent and the information transmission is with bounded time-varying delays. If the union of the communication topology across any time interval with some given length contains a spanning tree, the consensus problem is shown to be solvable. The analysis tool developed in this paper is based on nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a valid distributed consensus algorithm that overcomes the difficulties caused by unreliable communication channels, such as intermittent information transmission, switching communication topology, and time-varying communication delays, and therefore has its obvious practical applications. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results."",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Feng Xiao"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Feng-Xiao/144164477""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Long Wang"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Long-Wang/1715676""}],""publication"":""IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control"",""isPartOf"":""IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control"",""publisher"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""name"":""IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control""},""copyrightYear"":""2006"",""datePublished"":""2006"",""image"":[{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""caption"":""Fig. 1.

Methods based, e.g., on various statistical tests are then used to yield parameters corresponding to probability of activation or activation strength. However, these methods do not indicate whether sets of voxels are activated in a similar way or in different ways. Typically, delays between two activated signals are not identified. In this article, we use clustering methods to detect similarities in activation between voxels. We employ a novel metric that measures the similarity between the activation stimulus and the fMRI signal. We present two different clustering algorithms and use them to identify regions of similar activations in an fMRI experiment involving a visual stimulus."",""author"":[{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Cyril Goutte"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Cyril-Goutte/2788842""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Peter Toft"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Peter-Toft/145467318""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Egill Rostrup"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Egill-Rostrup/3092550""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Finn rup Nielsen"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Finn-%C3%85rup-Nielsen/3110430""},{""@type"":""Person"",""name"":""Lars Kai Hansen"",""mainEntityOfPage"":""/author/Lars-Kai-Hansen/145579972""}],""publication"":""NeuroImage"",""isPartOf"":""NeuroImage"",""publisher"":{""@type"":""Organization"",""name"":""NeuroImage""},""copyrightYear"":""1999"",""datePublished"":""1999"",""image"":[{""@type"":""ImageObject"",""caption"":""FIG. 1.
